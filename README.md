# Robot Framework Tutorial

#### Author : Rahul Bhoyar

Welcome to the Robot Framework Tutorial! In this tutorial, you'll learn how to automate tests using Robot Framework, a popular open-source test automation framework.

## What is Robot Framework?

Robot Framework is a generic open-source automation framework for acceptance testing, acceptance test-driven development (ATDD), and robotic process automation (RPA). It is easy to learn and use, yet powerful enough to automate complex test cases.

## Getting Started

To get started with Robot Framework, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Install Python on your system if you haven't already. Then, install Robot Framework and any necessary libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Writing Test Cases**: Create your test cases using Robot Framework's easy-to-read syntax. Test cases are written in plain text files with a `.robot` extension.

4. **Executing Test Cases**: Run your test cases using the `robot` command-line tool. For example:

```
robot tests/*.robot
```

5. **Analyzing Results**: Review the test execution report generated by Robot Framework to analyze test results and identify any failures or issues.
